Module 1 challenge Code Refactory
This assignment is to improve accessibility to the website.
The website did not have alt function for the images which was added in order to increase accessibility to describe what each image shows.
The heading attributes were not matching with the description. For example Search Engine Optimization is more related to Brand Awareness.
