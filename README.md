Module 1 challenge Code Refactory
This assignment is to improve accessibility to the website.
The website did not have alt function for the images which was added in order to increase accessibility to describe what each image shows. There were 6 images in total so 6 descriptions were added to HTML code behind image sources links.
The heading attributes were not matching with the description. For example Search Engine Optimization is more related to Brand Awareness. So these were switched around by altering order in HTML file.
The title of the website was previously just website so this was changed to be more relevant e.g.  Horiseon - your social media solution.
Semantic elements were slightly changed by putting footer as footer, rather than as division within the body.
