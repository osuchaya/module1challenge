## Module 1 challenge Code Refactory

This assignment is to improve accessibility to the website through code refactoring without modifying the overall structure with
aim to enhance the function of the application. To do this, the following actions were implemented:

The website did not have alt function for the images which was added in order to increase accessibility to describe what each image shows. There were 6 images in total so 6 descriptions were added to HTML code behind image sources links.

The heading attributes were not matching with the description. For example Search Engine Optimization is more related to Brand Awareness. So these were switched around by altering order in HTML file.

The title of the website was previously just "website" so this was changed to be more relevant e.g.  Horiseon - your social media solution, in order to optimize when being searched by search engine.

Semantic elements were slightly changed by putting footer as footer, rather than as division within the body.

According to Technical Acceptance Criteria, CSS selectors can be consolidated. Therefore, this was also implemented.

## Learning Points

The author has undergone a very steep learning curve in this challenge as it was to understand the whole work flow of generating
repositories, make alterations and use functions such as git for committing any changes.
